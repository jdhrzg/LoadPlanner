# LoadPlanner
## Stack
The plan is for this to have a MaterialUI + React front end, with C# Asp.Net Core API, EF Core ORM, a Postgres SQL DB and to be hosted on Azure or AWS.

## Why a Load Planner app?
It fits in my professional dev niche of logistics and/or blue-collar industry focused software.  I love visualizing data and mathy problems.  Also, this seemed like a perfectly large undertaking... big enough to be "real" but small enough to finish.  ...I think it could be sold someday too.

I plan on keeping this project alive for a long time... rewriting and maintaining it for fun or to learn something new.  
Ex: works on Azure, how about AWS?  
Ex: New version of .Net, upgrade this to learn.

## Goal
Build a web application that helps logistics planners optimize the loading of trucks, trailers, or containers based on cargo dimensions, weight, and delivery destinations.

_View the Issues and Projects tabs to see how I'm organizing this project.  Artifacts of my planning will be hosted here as well (diagrams, documentation, etc)._

## User stories to cover:  
- As a planner, I want to create a load and add multiple cargo items.  
- As a planner, I want the system to validate that the load doesn’t exceed weight/space limits.  
- As a planner, I want to see a visual representation of how efficiently the load is packed.  
- As a driver, I want to see the list of loads and delivery stops assigned to me.  
- As an admin, I want to manage users and trucks.  

## Milestones
- ER Diagram (DONE)
- Basic wireframes for pages
- Begin front end development.  Use mocked API "back-end".  Build out front end super-Minimally Viable Product.
- Minimal running back end project connected to front end
  - Technical architecture diagram?
- Hook things up "for real", fill out features with functionality and wire through the full stack
- ... (Start to implement things, focus on 1 MVP step per iteration (small bites, keep simple, add complexity later))
