_View the Issues and Projects tabs to see how I'm organizing this project.  Artifacts of my planning will be hosted here as well (diagrams, documentation, etc)._

## User stories to cover:  
- As a planner, I want to create a load and add multiple cargo items.  
- As a planner, I want the system to validate that the load doesnâ€™t exceed weight/space limits.  
- As a planner, I want to see a visual representation of how efficiently the load is packed.  
- As a driver, I want to see the list of loads and delivery stops assigned to me.  
- As an admin, I want to manage users and trucks.  

## Milestones
- ER Diagram
- Wireframes for pages
- Technical architecture diagram
- Running back end project
- Running front end project connected to back end project
- ... (Start to implement things, focus on 1 MVP step per iteration (small bites, keep simple, add complexity later))
