# LoadPlanner
See progress here:
https://jdhrzg.github.io/LoadPlanner/src/

**NOTE: Right now I am building out a very simple start to this app in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS to learn the mechanics of that (pains in that).  Soon I will swap every thing over to React and really begin this project in earnest.**

## Goal
Build a web application that helps logistics planners optimize the loading of trucks, trailers, or containers based on cargo dimensions, weight, and delivery destinations.

Helpful overview of [Load Planning Software](https://www.cleveroad.com/blog/load-planning-software)

_View the Issues and Projects tabs to see how I'm organizing this project.  Artifacts of my planning will be hosted here as well (diagrams, documentation, etc)._

## User stories to cover:  
- As a planner, I want to create a load and add multiple cargo items.  
- As a planner, I want the system to validate that the load doesn’t exceed weight/space limits.  
- As a planner, I want to see a visual representation of how efficiently the load is packed.  
- As a driver, I want to see the list of loads and delivery stops assigned to me.  
- As an admin, I want to manage users and trucks.  

## Milestones
- ER Diagram (DONE)
- Basic wireframes for pages
- Begin front end development.  Use mocked API "back-end".  Build out front end super-Minimally Viable Product.
- Minimal running back end project connected to front end
  - Technical architecture diagram?
- Hook things up "for real", fill out features with functionality and wire through the full stack
- ... (Start to implement things, focus on 1 MVP step per iteration (small bites, keep simple, add complexity later))
